### v0.8.1 [view commit logs](https://github.com/chancancode/json_expressions/compare/0.8.0...0.8.1)

* Fat finger: reverted a change in 0.8.0 which changed the default value of `assume_unordered_arrays` from true to false. Added tests to make sure this never happens again.

### v0.8.0 [view commit logs](https://github.com/chancancode/json_expressions/compare/0.7.2...0.8.0)

* Added Test::Unit support.
* Added MiniTest::Spec support.
* BREAKING: Changed internal structure of MiniTest support code. This shouldn't affect you unless you have been manually requiring and including the MiniTest helpers yourself.
* Use of `WILDCARD_MATCHER` (the constant) inside a `MiniTest::Unit::TestCase` is now discouraged. Instead, you are encouraged to use `wildcard_matcher` (the method) instead. README has been updated.
* Removed WILDCARD_MATCHER#match and the corresponding test. Since support for Object#match has been removed in v0.7.0, this should no longer be necessary.
